## 🦥 My Laziness Product!

This extension is the direct result of my laziness! 🎯

### 🤔 Why was this extension created?

When I had to press `Ctrl + F5` to reload a page, I felt like I was wasting too much energy. So I decided to find a simpler way!

### 📊 Energy Savings Calculations:

**Energy consumed for pressing Ctrl+F5:**

- Moving hand to keyboard: 2 calories
- Pressing Ctrl key: 1 calorie
- Pressing F5 key: 1 calorie
- **Total: 4 calories**

**Energy consumed with extension:**

- Moving hand to mouse: 1 calorie
- Right-click: 0.5 calories
- Selecting option from menu: 0.5 calories
- **Total: 2 calories**

**🎉 Savings: 2 calories per use!**

### 🍕 Food equivalent savings:

- In 100 uses: 200 calories = Half an apple 🍎
- In 1000 uses: 2000 calories = A full pizza! 🍕
- In 10000 uses: 20000 calories = 5 kg of weight! ⚖️

### 🏃‍♂️ Exercise equivalent:

Saving 2 calories equals:

- 30 seconds of walking 🚶‍♂️
- 15 seconds of running 🏃‍♂️
- 10 seconds of swimming 🏊‍♂️

**Result: With this extension, you burn calories without exercising! 😄**
